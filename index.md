# About

This website details research done at the [Hazan group](https://www.ehazan.com/) at Princeton University. 
We conduct research in machine learning, mathematical optimziation, control theory and game theory, more details [here](https://www.minregret.com/research/). 

Some of this research is also in collaboration with [Google Brain Princeton](https://sites.google.com/view/gbrainprinceton/home), a separate group of research scientists in the Princeton area.

## Projects
We are currently working on several projects, including two longer-term efforts:
1. **[deluca](http://deluca.fyi)**: An OpenAI Gym inspired library that provides differentiable environments, agents that take advantage of such environments, and benchmarking tools.
2. **[deluca-lung](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06779.pdf)**: Machine learning for mechanical ventilator control.
