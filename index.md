# About

This website details research done at the [Hazan group](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/) at Princeton University and [Google AI Princeton](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/12/google-ai-princeton-current-and-future.html).

## Projects
We are currently working on several projects, including two longer-term efforts:
1. **[deluca](http://deluca.fyi)**: An OpenAI Gym inspired library that provides differentiable environments, agents that take advantage of such environments, and benchmarking tools.
2. **[venti](https://github.com/MinRegret/venti)**: Machine learning for mechanical ventilator control.
